                        <h4>Title: Electromagnetic clutches</h4>
                        <p>
                            Electromagnetic clutches operate electrically but transmit torque mechanically.
                            This is why they used to be referred to as electro-mechanical clutches. Over the years,
                            EM became known as electromagnetic versus electro-mechanical, referring more about their
                            actuation method versus physical operation. Since the clutches started becoming popular
                            over 60 years ago, the variety of applications and clutch designs has increased
                            dramatically,
                            but the basic operation remains the same today.
                            Single-face clutches make up approximately 90% of all electromagnetic clutch sales.
                            Electromagnetic clutches are most suitable for remote operation since no mechanical linkages
                            are required to control their engagement, providing fast, smooth operation. However, because
                            the activation energy dissipates as heat in the electromagnetic actuator when the clutch is
                            engaged, there is a risk of overheating. Consequently, the maximum operating temperature of
                            the clutch is limited by the temperature rating of the insulation of the electromagnet. This
                            is a major limitation. Another disadvantage is higher initial cost.
                            When the electromagnetic clutch is used in automobiles, there may be a clutch release switch
                            inside the gear lever. The driver operates the switch by holding the gear lever to change
                            the gear, thus cutting off current to the electromagnet and disengaging the clutch. With
                            this mechanism, there is no need to depress the clutch pedal. Alternatively, the switch may
                            be replaced by a touch sensor or proximity sensor which senses the presence of the hand near
                            the lever and cuts off the current. The advantages of using this type of clutch for
                            automobiles are that complicated linkages are not required to actuate the clutch, and the
                            driver needs to apply a considerably reduced force to operate the clutch. It is a type of
                            semi-automatic transmission.

                            Electromagnetic clutches are also often found in AWD systems, and are used to vary the
                            amount of power sent to individual wheels or axles.

                            In most vehicular ac systems with open-drive compressors of different displacement, a
                            smaller electromagnetic clutch connects the air conditioning compressor's shaft end to a
                            pulley driven by the engine's crankshaft, often through another pulley and a belt, allowing
                            the compressor to cycle on only when needed. Some compressors featured in automobile ac
                            systems, however, don't feature such clutch and therefore they're permanently driven by the
                            engine, being their volumetric flow rate controlled (through a solenoid valve installed on
                            the compressor's body) and not their operating state.

                            Electromagnetic clutches have been used on diesel locomotives, e.g. by Hohenzollern
                            Locomotive Works.
